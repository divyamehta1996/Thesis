How to Start Tensorflow:
* go to tensorflow directory : cd tensorflow 
* start an environment : source ./bin/activate 
* run python script 
* exit environment : deactivate 

Ideas: 
- Scrape Allsides website for new more up to date data 
- Effects of neutral sentences/phrases being added? 
- multiple forms of validation schemes, different things imporve different merics? 
- expand sentence level predictions to document level through some aggregate algorithm 
- scraper to download live articles to enhance training? 
- tool to test new articles as you are reading 
- bias is just binary/trinary: liberal? conservative? neutral? -> aggregate precentages over an entire article? 

Analysis that can be run: 
- Article scores across an author
- Article scores across different sources 

Steps:
- why did neutral do so bad? -> how to add in non-binary labels? 
- upload to AWS so computer doesn't explode
- why was K-fold so bad? -> data set too small?


Tree Structure in IBC Data
# Each sub-array is an array of nodes of type nodeObj 
# Each tree element is a nodeObj(iterable tree) containing: 
    # some nodeObjs containing a phrase with a label 
    # some nodeObjs containing a phrase with no label 
    # some leafObjs that break the phrases down into indivdiual words with some annotation
